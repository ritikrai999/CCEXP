* Overload API functions to use the same name for named or ID-used access.

* Update to thread-safe system
	A CCEXP object should only change it's data when all previous modifications on it, have been finished. Otherwise it should produce error.
	
* Update Error return System
	A) When an error is occurred a different value than -1 should be returned, with much more meaning!
	B) Error Number explanation function should be considered.

* Simplify code.
	1. Remove multiple duplications (i.e. common Table-Search code in every method)
	2. Make code more readable

* Add Documentation to the code (doxygen based), thus users can understand it more easily.
